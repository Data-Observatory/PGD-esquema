# RDA DMP Common Standard for machine-actionable Data Management Plans

This is a minimum set of universal terms that we agree on which ensure basic interoperability of systems using maDMPS. Further fields can be added in specific deployments, but they do not guarantee interoperability. DMP tools can use any other fields in their internal data models.

This standard allows modelling a wide range of use cases and does not set any business (e.g. funder specific) requirements. It allows modelling information over the whole DMP lifecycle.

Cardinalities: each field in this model can be expected to appear as part of a message exchanged between systems. However, not all of fields or classes are required [0..1] or [0..*].
