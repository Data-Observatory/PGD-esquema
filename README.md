## Documentation
Documentation of the maDMP standard can be found [here](https://github.com/RDA-DMP-Common/RDA-DMP-Common-Standard/blob/master/docs/index.md)

It is also available as a [diagram](https://github.com/RDA-DMP-Common/RDA-DMP-Common-Standard/tree/master/docs/diagrams)

Slides and presentations explaining the broader context of the model can be found on the webpage of the [RDA DMP Common Standards WG](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/dmp-common-standards-wg) 

## Examples
